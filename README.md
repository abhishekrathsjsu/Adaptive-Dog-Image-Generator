# Alchemy-Technical-Competency-Test

Hi! I am Abhishek Rath. This repository contains my answers to Alchemy Global Solutions' Technical Competency Test. The test has two parts:
i) Conceptual questions
ii) Coding question

# Conceptual Questions

The files containing questions and answers are in separate files in .pdf format.

# Coding Question - Random Image Generator
The webpage gives out random dog images brought in dog.io API when the button on the screen is clicked. There are three files for this coding question in .html, .css and .js format.
## index.html
This file contains the HTML file which contains all the main elements of the webpage like title, text and button. This file only defines the bare structure for the website.
## style.css
The CSS file defines the orientation of the elements present in the website.
## script.js
The javascript file is responsible for calling the dog.io API which is called from index.html and display the images from the API.
## Output
Below is a screenshot of the designed webpage
